# Simon Game 

This a memory game. The program starts off by showing which block to start at by flashing for a quick second. 
You have to click the correct block. 
The game will continue by showing you the next block, but it's the user's job to remember the sequence because when you click on the blocks, the clicks have to be in the correct order leading up to the most recent one shown to you. 
The game will restart once the user clicks the incorrect block.
